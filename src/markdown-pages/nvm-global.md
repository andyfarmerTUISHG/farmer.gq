If you have a list of default packages you want installed every time you install a new version, we support that too -- just add the package names, one per line, to the file \$NVM_DIR/default-packages. You can add anything npm would accept as a package argument on the command line. My personal ones as at 15 July 2020.

# \$NVM_DIR/default-packages

nodemon
gatsby-cli
sonar-scanner
ntl
nodemon
npm
